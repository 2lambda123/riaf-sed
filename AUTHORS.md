# [Rodrigo Nemmen](http://rodrigonemmen.com)

- Wrote the eigenvalue solver (`dyn.pl`) which finds the transonic physical solution by means of the shooting method. 
- Wrote the Perl codes that make the SED generation much more convenient, including: • accepting input parameter file • log file with convenient radial structure quantities 
- Wrote tutorial on how to use the code
- Wrote the parallel version of the radiative transfer solver with OpenMP
