Here is a list of people who contributed to this project.

# [Feng Yuan](http://center.shao.ac.cn/fyuan/yuan.html)

Main author of the code. Wrote the Fortran solvers for the radial structure (`dynamics.f`) and the radiative transfer (`spectrum.f`).

# [Rodrigo Nemmen](http://rodrigonemmen.com)

- Wrote the eigenvalue solver (`dyn.pl`) which finds the transonic physical solution by means of the shooting method. 
- Wrote the Perl codes that make the SED generation much more convenient, including: • accepting input parameter file • log file with convenient radial structure quantities 
- Wrote tutorial on how to use the code
- Wrote the parallel version of the radiative transfer solver with OpenMP
